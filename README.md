# What to ask the assistant
Currently there are two services that the assistant can do for you

1. Reserve a tennis court
2. Check out the court availabilities

## How to reserve a tennis court:
Ask the assistant to reserve a tennis court for you. You may use the following prompt or anything similar to this. 

`book a court for me and Alejandro for tomorrow at 7pm.`

## How to check out the available spots:

`what are the available spots for next Friday?`





### Happy booking! üè∏
